# CompSci315
Code from my CSCI-315 class:  Artificial Intelligence Through Deep Learning

##Description
The goal of this course is to give you the skills and knowledge to participate in the exciting new field of Deep Learning. For the first half of the course you will learn to design, train, and test neural networks using the NumPy package in Python. In the second half of the course you will learn how to use the powerful Theano Python package to train and test much more powerful deep-learning networks that exploit the Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) available on our computers. In addition to being able to design, train, and test Deep Learning networks, you will gain an understanding of the history and philolsophy of AI, the current challenges it faces, and the prospects for the future.
